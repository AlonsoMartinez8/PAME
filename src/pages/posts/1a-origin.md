p1: "PAME is an online wardrobe that allows you to register your clothes and share them with other people who use the platform. You can organize your closet, categorize your clothes and interact with your friends. It also includes a personalized smart assistant for your profile."
p2: "This platform arises from the task of carrying out a student's final degree project, specifically, my final degree project.
Not only does it originate from an obligation, but it is also a great opportunity to develop myself in the field of computer development and to offer other users an original and practical service for managing their garments."
