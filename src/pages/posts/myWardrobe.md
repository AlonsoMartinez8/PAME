p1: "My Wardrobe is your Wardrobe Online. There you can manage your clothes and categories."
p2: "It has a category slider and another for clothing. In the categories section you can add and configure your categories. In the garments section you can perform the previous functions and also view your garments in two ways: mosaic and carousel. You can also add the clothes to your outfit in the future since My Wardrobe has the full functionality of My Outfit"
p3: "My advice when using this section is, first of all, create a series of categories with which you will organize your clothes and then add these garments to their specific category."
